         * The Painter's Partition Problem-II
         * Difficulty: HardAccuracy: 27.52%Submissions: 129K+Points: 8
         * Dilpreet wants to paint his dog's home that has n boards with different
         * lengths. The length of ith board is given by arr[i] where arr[] is an array
         * of n integers. He hired k painters for this work and each painter takes 1
         * unit time to paint 1 unit of the board.
         * 
         * Return the minimum time to get this job done if all painters start together
         * with the constraint that any painter will only paint continuous boards, say
         * boards numbered [2,3,4] or only board [1] or nothing but not boards [2,4,5].
         * 
         * Examples:
         * 
         * Input: arr[] = [5, 10, 30, 20, 15], k = 3
         * Output: 35
         * Explanation: The most optimal way will be: Painter 1 allocation : [5,10],
         * Painter 2 allocation : [30], Painter 3 allocation : [20,15], Job will be done
         * when all painters finish i.e. at time = max(5+10, 30, 20+15) = 35
         * Input: arr[] = [10, 20, 30, 40], k = 2
         * Output: 60
         * Explanation: The most optimal way to paint: Painter 1 allocation :
         * [10,20,30], Painter 2 allocation : [40], Job will be complete at time = 60
         * Input: arr[] = [100, 200, 300, 400], k = 1
         * Output: 1000
         * Explanation: There is only one painter, so the painter must paint all boards
         * sequentially. The total time taken will be the sum of all board lengths,
         * i.e., 100 + 200 + 300 + 400 = 1000.
         * Constraints:
         * 1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 105
         * 1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 105
         * 1 ≤ k ≤ 105
