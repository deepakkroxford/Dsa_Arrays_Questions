         * You are given an array arr[] of integers, where each element arr[i]
         * represents the number of pages in the ith book. You also have an integer k
         * representing the number of students. The task is to allocate books to each
         * student such that:
         * 
         * Each student receives atleast one book.
         * Each student is assigned a contiguous sequence of books.
         * No book is assigned to more than one student.
         * The objective is to minimize the maximum number of pages assigned to any
         * student. In other words, out of all possible allocations, find the
         * arrangement where the student who receives the most pages still has the
         * smallest possible maximum.
         * 
         * Note: Return -1 if a valid assignment is not possible, and allotment should
         * be in contiguous order (see the explanation for better understanding).
         * 
         * Examples:
         * 
         * Input: arr[] = [12, 34, 67, 90], k = 2
         * Output: 113
         * Explanation: Allocation can be done in following ways:
         * [12] and [34, 67, 90] Maximum Pages = 191
         * [12, 34] and [67, 90] Maximum Pages = 157
         * [12, 34, 67] and [90] Maximum Pages = 113.
         * Therefore, the minimum of these cases is 113, which is selected as the
         * output.
         * Input: arr[] = [15, 17, 20], k = 5
         * Output: -1
         * Explanation: Allocation can not be done.
         * Input: arr[] = [22, 23, 67], k = 1
         * Output: 112
         * Constraints:
         * 1 <= arr.size() <= 106
         * 1 <= arr[i] <= 103
         * 1 <= k <= 103
