         * leetcode 1011:
         * https://leetcode.com/problems/capacity-to-ship-packages-within-d-days/
         * A conveyor belt has packages that must be shipped from one port to another
         * within days days.
         * 
         * The ith package on the conveyor belt has a weight of weights[i]. Each day, we
         * load the ship with packages on the conveyor belt (in the order given by
         * weights). We may not load more weight than the maximum weight capacity of the
         * ship.
         * 
         * Return the least weight capacity of the ship that will result in all the
         * packages on the conveyor belt being shipped within days days.
         * 
         * 
         * 
         * Example 1:
         * 
         * Input: weights = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10], days = 5
         * Output: 15
         * Explanation: A ship capacity of 15 is the minimum to ship all the packages in
         * 5 days like this:
         * 1st day: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
         * 2nd day: 6, 7
         * 3rd day: 8
         * 4th day: 9
         * 5th day: 10
         * 
         * Note that the cargo must be shipped in the order given, so using a ship of
         * capacity 14 and splitting the packages into parts like (2, 3, 4, 5), (1, 6,
         * 7), (8), (9), (10) is not allowed.
         * Example 2:
         * 
         * Input: weights = [3,2,2,4,1,4], days = 3
         * Output: 6
         * Explanation: A ship capacity of 6 is the minimum to ship all the packages in
         * 3 days like this:
         * 1st day: 3, 2
         * 2nd day: 2, 4
         * 3rd day: 1, 4
         * Example 3:
         * 
         * Input: weights = [1,2,3,1,1], days = 4
         * Output: 3
         * Explanation:
         * 1st day: 1
         * 2nd day: 2
         * 3rd day: 3
         * 4th day: 1, 1
         *
