         * position of a stall. You are also given an integer k which denotes the number
         * of aggressive cows. Your task is to assign stalls to k cows such that the
         * minimum distance between any two of them is the maximum possible.
         * 
         * Examples :
         * 
         * Input: stalls[] = [1, 2, 4, 8, 9], k = 3
         * Output: 3
         * Explanation: The first cow can be placed at stalls[0],
         * the second cow can be placed at stalls[2] and
         * the third cow can be placed at stalls[3].
         * The minimum distance between cows, in this case, is 3, which also is the
         * largest among all possible ways.
         * Input: stalls[] = [10, 1, 2, 7, 5], k = 3
         * Output: 4
         * Explanation: The first cow can be placed at stalls[0],
         * the second cow can be placed at stalls[1] and
         * the third cow can be placed at stalls[4].
         * The minimum distance between cows, in this case, is 4, which also is the
         * largest among all possible ways.
         * Input: stalls[] = [2, 12, 11, 3, 26, 7], k = 5
         * Output: 1
         * Explanation: Each cow can be placed in any of the stalls, as the no. of
         * stalls are exactly equal to the number of cows.
         * The minimum distance between cows, in this case, is 1, which also is the
         * largest among all possible ways.
