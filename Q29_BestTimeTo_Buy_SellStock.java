         * You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock
         * and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.
         * 
         * Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you

         * 
         *

         * Example 1:
         * Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
         * Output: 5
         * Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit =
         * 6-1 = 5.
         * Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you
         * must buy before you sell.
         *

         * Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
         * Output: 0
         * Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.
