        /*
         * Given an unsorted array Arr of size N of positive integers. One number 'A'
         * from set {1, 2,....,N} is missing and one number 'B' occurs twice in array.
         * Find these two numbers.
         * 
         * Example 1:
         * 
         * Input:
         * N = 2
         * Arr[] = {2, 2}
         * Output: 2 1
         * Explanation: Repeating number is 2 and
         * smallest positive missing number is 1.
         * Example 2:
         * 
         * Input:
         * N = 3
         * Arr[] = {1, 3, 3}
         * Output: 3 2
         * Explanation: Repeating number is 3 and
         * smallest positive missing number is 2.
         * Your Task:
         * You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the
         * function findTwoElement() which takes the array of integers arr and n as
         * parameters and returns an array of integers of size 2 denoting the answer (
         * The first index contains B and second index contains A.)
         * 
         * Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
         * Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)
         * 
         * Constraints:
         * 2 ≤ N ≤ 105
         * 1 ≤ Arr[i] ≤ N
         * 
         * //4, 3, 6, 2, 1,1
